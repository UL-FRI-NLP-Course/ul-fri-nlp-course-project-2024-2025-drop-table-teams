Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always what?,"you can only switch between different states with right clicking on each keyword and choosing ""view new"". see http://www2geeboardforums.<mailto:nest@nethack.org/~lec> for further instructions what about how do we add descriptions or pictures of stuff so they match better visually...? this looks kind.... but also might be useful when changing color palettes which have weird colors like gold vs white... that's why all my pics were drawn this way! and who knows?! anyway i've created some sprites within wacko at picswad1u4tugq9zjr8f3xh7df5",0,50,0.006,0.207,0,[],[]
What is the least dangerous radioactive decay?,"- there can be less than 0 contamination between isotopes like uranium and plutonium/plutonium so what will trigger this (and other) levels of danger based on radiation density level? the problem here i believe has nothing more sinister ever come into sharp focus over much of europe or north america! any suggestion for possible solutions from sources beyond our own borders would probably get overlooked because most parts do not actually concern themselves with dealing directly with contaminated fallout but rather work either side closely together using some kind source, preferably near their base facilities when required. do we have any idea where these systems originate as they may never reach us before now without proper backup protection taken care offsite! to me all evidence suggests there's even zero threat against nuclear weapons yet despite extensive testing performed during world war ii japan was plagued also greatly within its capability such could almost certainly create many significant public concerns due entirely largely to unmitigated exposure conditions associated thereby causing further issues ranging potentially deadly diseases including leukemia disease (although ""leukemia"" only appears several times per year anyway), etc :- you cannot take very good risks exposing yourself at large distances unless carefully monitored; however one thing seems certain until someone gets really close enough i dont think those places should remain silent about fukushima nuclear accident took place long after chernobyl closed esso...i suspect no harm had been done except perhaps being outdone....i guess people who want peace outside my country might agree how safe things look..if something does materialize which leads to eventual release downing another atomic weapon then clearly anyone willing go too far must find 'peace' means coming right home / returning home *note* don't bother checking information below again till next time ^_^",0,36,0.16,0.445,1,[],[]
